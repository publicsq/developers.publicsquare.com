# Cancel Payouts

There may be scenarios in which you need to cancel a payout, such as paying a customer or vendor by mistake.

PublicSquare API offers the ability to cancel a payout before it is settled.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Cancel the Payout

In order to cancel a payout, we will need the ID of a recently created payout. Assuming you have a payout similar to:

```json showLineNumbers title="Authorized Payment"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "pyt_24NFPd3jSZFTxiaH9UwjuqNdP",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "pending",
  ...
}
```

We need to make a call to [Cancel Payout](/api/financial/cancels-a-payout) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payouts/cancel' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "payout_id": "pyt_24NFPd3jSZFTxiaH9UwjuqNdP"
}'
```

## Payout Response

Given the above examples, you should see a cancelled payout result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pyt_24NFPd3jSZFTxiaH9UwjuqNdP",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
   // highlight-next-line
  "status": "cancelled",
  "transaction_id": "trx_6QgmXzQzk3S5K5EsR3DfEiMRj",
  "amount": 1000,
  ...
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_6QgmXzQzk3S5K5EsR3DfEiMRj",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    // highlight-next-line
    "status": "cancelled",
    "amount": -1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": -1000,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Handling Cancellation Failures

If a payout cannot be cancelled because the payout has already been settled, an error response will be returned:

```shell showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Error",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "payout cancellation failed."
}
```
