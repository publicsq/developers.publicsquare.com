# View Settlements

At the end of every business day, all payments, payouts, and refunds are settled. During this process, funds are either deposited or withdrawn from your business
bank account based upon the sum of that days transactions. This process generates a Settlement record in the PublicSquare system which summarizes that days transactions and creates an association
with the transactions in that days' batch.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Retrieve a Settlement

We will assume we have a settlement with ID `stl_BGDLZjBLAgNbyqCzJxchSoh5k` to pull information about the settlement.

We need to make a call to [Get Settlement](/api/financial/get-settlement-by-id) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Transaction by ID"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/settlements/stl_BGDLZjBLAgNbyqCzJxchSoh5k' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

### Settlement Response

Given the above examples, you should see a transaction response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "stl_BGDLZjBLAgNbyqCzJxchSoh5k",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "payment_amount": 1500,
  "payment_count": 3,
  "refund_amount": 500,
  "refund_count": 1,
  "total_count": 4,
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "settled_at": "2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z",
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "production",
    "external_id": "e797ef3c-b586-4333-af90-7168d8427d85",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "amount": -1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": -1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
    "type": "payment",
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

## Get Transactions for a Settlement

You may also want to view all associated transactions for a settlement. We can leverage the [Get Transactions for a Settlement](/api/financial/get-all-transactions-for-a-settlement) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Transaction by ID"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/settlements/stl_BGDLZjBLAgNbyqCzJxchSoh5k/transactions' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

### Settlement's Transactions Response

This should return a [paginated result](/api/pagination) of transactions for the settlement:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "pagination": {
    "total_items": 924,
    "page_number": 1,
    "page_size": 10,
    "total_pages": 93
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
      "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
      "environment": "test",
      "status": "succeeded",
      "amount": 1000,
      "fee_amount": 36,
      "net_amount": 964,
      "currency": "USD",
      "type_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
      "type": "payment",
      // highlight-next-line
      "settlement_id": "stl_BGDLZjBLAgNbyqCzJxchSoh5k",
      "processor": "nuvei",
      "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
      "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
      "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
