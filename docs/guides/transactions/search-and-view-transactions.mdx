# Search and View Transactions

Every payment, payout, transfer, refund, and settlement in the PublicSquare system is associated with a transaction. PublicSquare leverages double entry accounting to track debit credits.
This helps with end of day reconciliation processes.

After completing the [Process Card Payments](/guides/payments/process-card-payments) guide, you may want to pull detailed information about the transaction.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Retrieve a Transaction

We will need to reference the payment's `transaction_id` to pull information about the payment.

For example, given you have a payment:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "succeeded",
  // highlight-next-line
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  ...
}
```

### Get Transaction by ID

We need to make a call to [Get Transaction](/api/financial/get-transaction-by-id) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Transaction by ID"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/transactions/trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG?include_type=true' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

### Transaction Response

Given the above examples, you should see a transaction response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",

      }
    },
    "customer": {
      "id": "cus_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ",

    },
    "billing_details": {
      "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
      "city": "Des Moines",
      "state": "IA",
      "postal_code": "51111",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "shipping_address": {
      "address_line_1": "111 Colorado Ave.",
      "address_line_2": "Apt 403",
      "city": "Des Moines",
      "state": "IA",
      "postal_code": "51111",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

## Search Transactions

In many cases, you may need to search transactions to find records associated with a specific customer, payment method, or an order ID from your system.
PublicSquare offers the ability to [search](/api/financial/get-all-transactions) and [export](/api/financial/export-transactions) across most fields of a customer, payment method, and transaction.

To perform a search, we can do the following:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Search Transactions"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/transactions?query=order1234' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

This should return a [paginated result](/api/pagination):

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "pagination": {
    "total_items": 924,
    "page_number": 1,
    "page_size": 10,
    "total_pages": 93
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
      "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
      "environment": "test",
      "status": "succeeded",
      // highlight-next-line
      "external_id": "order1234",
      "amount": 1000,
      "fee_amount": 36,
      "net_amount": 964,
      "currency": "USD",
      "type_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
      "type": "payment",
      "processor": "nuvei",
      "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
      "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
      "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
