# Authorize and Capture Payments

In some scenarios, your checkout process may collect and pre-authorize a purchase before the customer completes checkout. This is useful when you want to run a customer and card information against your fraud rules, enable pre-orders, or a multi-step checkout process.

Now that you have completed the [Collect Cards](/guides/payment-methods/collect-cards) guide, let's authorize and capture a card payment.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Authorize the Payment

We will need to use the information from the previously collected card to create a new payment.

For example, given you have a previously collected card:

```json showLineNumbers title=card.json
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "card_AjkCFKAYiTsjghXWMzoXFPMxj",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "cardholder_name": "John Smith",
  "last4": "4242",
  "exp_month": "12",
  "exp_year": "2025",
  "fingerprint": "CC2XvyoohnqecEq4r3FtXv6MdCx4TbaW1UUTdCCN5MNL",
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

### Create Authorized Payment

We need to make a call to [Create Payment](/api/financial/create-payment) endpoint passing `"capture": false` in the request body:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "capture": false,
  "payment_method": {
    "card": "card_AjkCFKAYiTsjghXWMzoXFPMxj"
  },
  "customer": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@email.com"
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  }
}'
```

<Alert>The amount is provided in cents. 1000 is the equivalent of $10.00</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">The IDEMPONTENCY-KEY header can be passed to protect against duplicate payments being processed.</Alert>

### Authorized Payment Response

You should see a payment response with a `requires_capture` status similar to:

```json showLineNumbers title="Authorized Payment Response"
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  // highlight-next-line
  "status": "requires_capture",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "amount": 0,
  "amount_charged": 0,
  "amount_capturable": 1000,
  "amount_refunded": 0,
  "refunded": false,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "card": {
      "id": "card_AjkCFKAYiTsjghXWMzoXFPMxj",
      "cardholder_name": "John Smith",
      "last4": "4242",
      "exp_month": "12",
      "exp_year": "2025",
      "brand": "visa",
      "avs_code": "Y",
      "cvv2_reply": "M",
      "fingerprint": "CC2XvyoohnqecEq4r3FtXv6MdCx4TbaW1UUTdCCN5MNL"
    }
  },
  "customer": {
    "id": "cus_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@email.com",
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "shipping_address": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Colorado Ave.",
    "address_line_2": "Apt 403",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "fraud_decision": {
    "decision": "accept"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    // highlight-next-line
    "status": "requires_capture",
    "amount": 1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
    "type": "payment",
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

If the payment authorization was declined by the processor or rejected because of fraud decisioning rules, you will see a payment `status` of `rejected` or `declined`. These payments cannot be captured.

## Capture the Payment

Using the authorized payment from the previous step, we now need to make a call to [Capture Payment](/api/financial/captures-a-payment) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Capture a Payment"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments/capture' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "amount": 1000
}'
```

You can capture up to, but not exceeding, the original authorized payment amount. If no `amount` is passed, the full authorized amount of the payment will be captured.

### Captured Payment Response

You should see a payment response with a `succeeded` status similar to:

```json showLineNumbers title="Captured Payment Response"
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  // highlight-next-line
  "status": "succeeded",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "amount": 1000,
  "amount_charged": 1000,
  "amount_capturable": 0,
  ...
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    // highlight-next-line
    "status": "succeeded",
    "amount": 1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": 1000,
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "processor_id": "7110000000010554769"
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Authorize and capturing payments also works with ACH payments using a bank account payment method.
See our [Process ACH payments](/guides/payments/process-ach-payments) guide to see how to collect bank accounts and process ACH payments following similar steps in this guide.

Now that we have seen how to authorize and capture payments with a collected card, we may need to manage the payment or view information about the payment.
