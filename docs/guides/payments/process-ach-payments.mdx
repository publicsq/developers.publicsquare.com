# Process ACH Payments

Now that you have completed the [Collect Bank Accounts](/guides/payment-methods/collect-bank-accounts) guide, let's process an ACH payment with the newly captured bank account.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Process the Payment

We will need to use the information from the previously collected bank account to create a new payment.

For example, given you have a previously collected bank account:

```json showLineNumbers title=bankAccount.json
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "ba_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "customer_id": "cus_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ",
  "account_holder_name": "John Doe",
  "account_holder_type": "individual",
  "account_type": "checking",
  "routing_number": "110000000",
  "account_number_last4": "1011",
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Colorado Ave.",
    "address_line_2": "Apt 403",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

### Create a Payment

We need to make a call to [Create Payment](/api/financial/create-payment) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "bank_account": "ba_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ"
  },
  "customer": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@email.com"
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  }
}'
```

<Alert>The amount is provided in cents. 1000 is the equivalent of $10.00</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">The IDEMPONTENCY-KEY header can be passed to protect against duplicate payments being processed.</Alert>

### Create with Existing Customer

If you [created a customer](/api/accounts/create-customer), then you can pass the `customer_id` when processing the payment:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment with Customer"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "bank_account": "ba_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ"
  },
  "customer": {
    "customer_id": "cus_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ"
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  }
}'
```

### Create with Customer's Payment Method

If you [attached the bank account to a customer](/api/financial/attach-bank-account-to-customer), then you can omit the `customer` section when processing the payment:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment with Payment Method"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "bank_account": "ba_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ"
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  }
}'
```

### Create with Payment Method's Billing Details

If you supplied the `billing_details` or [updated the bank account](/api/financial/update-bank-account), then you can omit the `billing_details` section when processing the payment:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment with Payment Method"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "bank_account": "ba_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ"
  }
}'
```
