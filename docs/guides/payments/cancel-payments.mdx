# Cancel Payments

There may be scenarios in which you need to cancel a payment, such as an authorized payment that had a fraud decision of `review` or a customer placed a payment by mistake and you need to cancel it before it is settled.

PublicSquare API offers the ability to cancel a payment before it is settled or captured.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Cancel the Payment

In order to cancel a payment, we will need the ID of an authorized or recently captured payment. Assuming you have a payment similar to:

```json showLineNumbers title="Authorized Payment"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "requires_capture",
  ...
}
```

We need to make a call to [Cancel Payment](/api/financial/cancels-a-payment) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments/cancel' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy"
}'
```

## Payment Response

Given the above examples, you should see a cancelled payment result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
   // highlight-next-line
  "status": "cancelled",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "amount": 1000,
  "amount_capturable": 0,
  "amount_charged": 1000,
  "amount_refunded": 0,
  "refunded": false,
  ...
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    // highlight-next-line
    "status": "cancelled",
    "amount": 1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": 1000,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Handling Cancellation Failures

If a payment cannot be cancelled because the payment has already been settled, an error response will be returned:

```shell showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Error",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "payment cancellation failed."
}
```

If payment cancellation fails, you can follow the [refund payment](/guides/refunds/refund-payments) guide.

## Conclusion
