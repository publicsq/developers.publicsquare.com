# Issue Refunds

After completing the [Process Process](/guides/merchants/process-payments) guide, you may need to issue a full or partial refund to the customer.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>


## Issue a Refund

We will need to reference the payment's `id` from the previously processed payment to create a refund.

For example, given you have a payment:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "amount": "1000",
  "amount_charged": "1000",
  "amount_refunded": "0",
  "refunded": "false",
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "card": {
      "id": "card_AjkCFKAYiTsjghXWMzoXFPMxj",
      "cardholder_name": "John Smith",
      "last4": "4242",
      "exp_month": "12",
      "exp_year": "2025",
      "fingerprint": "CC2XvyoohnqecEq4r3FtXv6MdCx4TbaW1UUTdCCN5MNL"
    }
  },
  "customer": {
    "id": "cus_7Ay5mcUXAxwrN6wQEQUVEHBCJ",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@email.com",
  },
  "billing_details": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Test St.",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "shipping_address": {
    "address_line_1": "111 Colorado Ave.",
    "address_line_2": "Apt 403",
    "city": "Des Moines",
    "state": "IA",
    "postal_code": "51111",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

We need to make a call to (Create Refund)(/api/create-refund) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Refund"
curl 'https://api.credova.com/refunds' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "reason": "Customer returned the item"
}'
```

<Alert>The amount is provided in cents. 1000 is the equivalent of $10.00</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">The IDEMPONTENCY-KEY header can be passed to protect against duplicate refunds being issued.</Alert>

Given the above examples, you should see a payment result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "amount": "1000",
  "currency": "USD",
  "reason": "Customer returned the item",
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

Now if you [retrieve the payment](/api/get-payment-by-id), you will see the payment info has updated:

Given the above examples, you should see a payment result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  ...
  //highlight-start
  "amount": "0",
  "amount_charged": "1000",
  "amount_refunded": "1000",
  "refunded": "true",
  //highlight-end
  ...
}
```

<Alert>The total you can refund cannot exceed the original amount of the payment.</Alert>

## Conclusion

This guide showed you how to issuea a refund for a payment.
You can issue multiple refunds towards the original payment as long as the total refunded amount does not exceed the original payment amount.
