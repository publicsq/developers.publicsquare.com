# Refund Payments

After completing the [Process Payments](/guides/payments/process-card-payments) guide, you may need to issue a full or partial refund to the customer.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Issue a Refund

We will need to reference the payment's `id` from the previously processed payment to create a refund.

For example, given you have a payment:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "amount": 1000,
  "amount_capturable": 0,
  "amount_charged": 1000,
  "amount_refunded": 0,
  "refunded": false,
  ...
}
```

We need to make a call to [Create Refund](/api/financial/create-refund) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Refund"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/refunds' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'IDEMPONTENCY-KEY: '09ec2c87-7fb8-44ca-bb18-5c71a76974da' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "reason": "Customer returned the item"
}'
```

<Alert>The amount is provided in cents. 1000 is the equivalent of $10.00</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">The IDEMPONTENCY-KEY header can be passed to protect against duplicate refunds being issued.</Alert>

Given the above examples, you should see a refund result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "reason": "Customer returned the item",
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    "status": "successful",
    "amount": -1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": -1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type_id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
    "type": "refund",
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

Now if you [retrieve the payment](/api/financial/get-payment-by-id), you will see the payment info has updated:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Payment by ID"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments/pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

Given the above examples, you should see a payment result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  ...
  //highlight-start
  "status": "successful",
  "amount": 0,
  "amount_capturable": 0,
  "amount_charged": 1000,
  "amount_refunded": 1000,
  "refunded": true,
  //highlight-end
  ...
}
```

<Alert>The total you can refund cannot exceed the original amount of the payment.</Alert>

## Payment Cancellation

PublicSquare will attempt to cancel a payment first if it has not been settled and the refund amount matches the payment amount. In that situation, a successful refund will still be created, but the associated payment will be cancelled.

You should see a refund result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "reason": "Cancelling payment",
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    "status": "successful",
    "amount": -1000,
    "fee_amount": 0,
    "net_amount": -1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type_id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
    "type": "refund",
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

Now if you [retrieve the payment](/api/financial/get-payment-by-id), you will see the payment info has updated:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Payment by ID"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payments/pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

You should see a payment result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  ...
  // highlight-next-line
  "status": "cancelled",
  "amount": 1000,
  "amount_capturable": 0,
  "amount_charged": 1000,
  "amount_refunded": 0,
  "refunded": false,
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion

This guide showed you how to issue a refund for a payment.
You can issue multiple refunds towards the original payment as long as the total refunded amount does not exceed the original payment amount.
