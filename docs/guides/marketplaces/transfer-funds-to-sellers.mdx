# Transfer Funds to Sellers

In this guide, we will show how marketplaces and other exchanges can transfer funds to and from seller accounts.

PublicSquare offers two transaction types for this use case:

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `payment_transfer` | Payment transfers are used to send funds to seller accounts from an existing `payment`. For instance, if you charge a customer $300, you can transfer $100 to three different sellers.                                                   |
| `refund_transfer`  | Refund transfers are used to retrieve funds from seller accounts from an existing `refund` referencing the original `payment_transfer`. For instance, if you refund a customer $300, you can transfer $100 from three different sellers. |

## Transfer Funds to Sellers

In order to move money from our captured payment to a seller's account, we will need a payment transfer.
Each payment may have exactly **one** payment transfer, who's total amount cannot exceed the payment's captured amount.

We will be using information from our [Process Card Payments](/guides/payments/process-card-payments) and [Onboard Sellers](/guides/marketplaces/onboard-sellers) guides:

First, grab the payment `id`:

```json showLineNumbers title="Payment"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  ...
}
```

Also our seller account `id`:

```json showLineNumbers title="Seller Account"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
  "name": "Test Seller",
  "type": "seller",
  ...
}
```

### Create a Payment Transfer

We will make a call to the [Create Payment Transfer](/api/financial/create-payment-transfer) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Payment Transfer"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/payment-transfers' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  // highlight-next-line
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "currency": "USD",
  "items": [{
    // highlight-next-line
    "seller_account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
    "amount": 1000,
    "transfer_fee": 100
  }]
}'
```

<Alert>The amount is provided in cents. 1000 is the equivalent of $10.00</Alert>

### Payment Transfer Response

You should see a payment transfer result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "trnf_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  "payment_id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "total_amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "items": [{
    "id": "trfi_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
    "seller_account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
    "amount": 1000,
    "transfer_fee": 100
  }],
  "transaction": {
    "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
    "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
    "environment": "test",
    "status": "successful",
    "amount": -1000,
    "fee_amount": 100,
    "net_amount": -900,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type_id": "trnf_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
    "type": "payment_transfer",
    "processor": "nuvei",
    "processor_id": "7110000000010554769",
    "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
    "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

<Alert>For each `item` in the payment transfer, a payment transaction will be created in the seller's account.</Alert>

## Transfer Funds from Sellers

After you have refunded a customer, you may need to transfer funds from a seller back into your account.
In order to do this, we will create a refund transfer.
Each refund may have exactly **one** refund transfer, who's total amount cannot exceed the refund amount.

We will be using information from our [Refund Payment](/guides/refunds/refund-payments) guide:

To start, let's get the refund `id`:

```json showLineNumbers title="Refund"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  ...
}
```

We will also be referencing our payment transfer's `id` and each item's `id`:

```json showLineNumbers title="Payment Transfer"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "trnf_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  ...
  "items": [{
    // highlight-next-line
    "id": "trfi_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
    "seller_account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
    "amount": 1000,
    "transfer_fee": 100
  }]
}
```

### Create a Refund Transfer

We will make a call to the [Create Refund Transfer](/api/financial/create-refund-transfer) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Refund Transfer"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/refund-transfers' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  // highlight-next-line
  "refund_id": "rfd_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  // highlight-next-line
  "payment_transfer_id": "trnf_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
  "items": [{
    // highlight-next-line
    "payment_transfer_item_id": "trfi_7yFLQWACr3DYDSz1xpoEAVfdq",
    "amount": 1000,
    "transfer_fee": 100
  }]
}'
```
