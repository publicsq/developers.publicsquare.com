# Onboard Sellers

As a marketplace, you will need to create and onboard your sellers to be able to transfer funds to them. Every seller within your marketplace will need a seller account created with PublicSquare.

This guide will walk you through how to create and onboard seller accounts.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>

## Create a Seller Account

The first step is to create a seller account that will be fully managed by your merchant account.

We need to make a call to [Create Account](/api/accounts/create-account) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Seller Account"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "name": "Test Seller",
  "type": "seller"
}'
```

This will return a seller account result similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
  "name": "Test Seller",
  "type": "seller",
  "payments_onboarding_status": "not_started",
  "credit_onboarding_status": "not_started",
  "seller_onboarding_status": "not_started",
  "products": ["seller"],
  "managed_by": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

## Save Business Details

Referencing the `id` of the previously created seller account, we can now save business details for our seller account.

PublicSquare exposes several endpoints to enable you to submit all of the required business details:

* [Save Business Details](/api/accounts/save-business-by-account-id)
* [Save Business Representative](/api/accounts/save-business-representative-by-account-id)
* [Save Business Tax Information](/api/accounts/save-tax-information-by-account-id)
* [Create Ultimate Beneficial Owner](/api/accounts/create-ultimate-beneficial-owner-by-account-id)
* [Upload Business Document](/api/accounts/upload-business-document-by-account-id)

<Alert>For all of the endpoints listed above, be sure to replace the `accountId` field with the seller's account ID from the previous step.</Alert>

## Collect Business Bank Account

PublicSquare has partnered with [Flinks](https://www.flinks.com/) to provide a secure way to collect bank accounts.

### Retrieve the iFrame URL

To start the process, we need to [get a bank account verification iFrame URL](/api/accounts/get-bank-verification-url):

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create a Seller Account"
curl -L 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts/acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf/business/bank-account/verification' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

This will return a response containing an iFrame URL you can mount on your site to prompt the seller to provide their business bank account:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "authorization_url": "https://verification.publicsquare.com?authorizeToken=d65f1adb-8ebc-48dc-be8b-20c773ba1565&tag=acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf"
}
```

### Process Bank Verification

Using the bank account verification iFrame URL from the previous step, we can mount it to our page and setup an event listener:

```html showLineNumbers title="onboarding.html"
<script type="text/javascript">
  const handleMessage = async (e) => {
    const data = e.data;

    if (data && typeof data === 'object') {
      switch (data.step) {
        case 'APP_MOUNTED': {
          // Show iFrame
          setIsLoading(false);
          break;
        }
        case 'REDIRECT': {
          if (data.loginId && data.requestId) {
            const res = await fetch('https://yourapi.com/bank-account-verification', {
              method: 'POST',
              body: {
                verification_code: data.loginId,
                request_id: data.requestId,
              },
            });
          }
          break;
        }
        case 'INSTITUTION_NOT_AVAILABLE':
        case 'INSTITUTION_SEARCH_NO_RESULT': {
          // Show manual bank account collection
          setShowManualBankAccountForm(true);
          break;
        }
        default:
          break;
      }
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);
</script>

<iframe
  height="760"
  src={bankAccountVerification.authorization_url}
  title="Bank Account Verification"
/>
```

Using the code above, your API should receive a `verification_code` and `request_id` which we can then [trigger the bank verification process](/api/accounts/save-bank-verification):

```shell showLineNumbers title="API call on your server"
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts/acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf/business/bank-account/verification' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "verification_code": "5e115eac-1209-4f19-641c-08d6d484e2fe",
  "request_id": "a5b739e0-9448-484d-b553-77d7fb8567e0"
}'
```

This will return a bank account verification result:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "bank_account_verification_id": "bav_2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4"
}
```

### Save Seller Bank Account

Once we have the `bank_account_verification_id`, we can then [save the bank account](/api/accounts/save-bank-account-by-account-id) for the seller:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts/acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf/business/bank-account' \
-X 'PUT' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "bank_account_verification_id": "bav_2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4"
}'
```

This will save the business bank account for the seller and return the resulting bank account:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "bba_A4Ud7DxT2mGyj8hEyHx2KSfsp",
  "account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
  "bank_account_verification_id": "bav_2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4",
  "account_holder_name": "Test Corporation",
  "account_holder_type": "company",
  "account_type": "checking",
  "routing_number": "110000000",
  "account_number_last4": "1720",
  "status": "verified",
  "fingerprint": "CC2XvyoohnqecEq4r3FtXv6MdCx4TbaW1UUTdCCN5MNL",
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```
<Alert>If PublicSquare has not yet received a response back from Flinks, we will return a `202 - Accepted` HTTP status code. Please retry the request.</Alert>

## Submit Onboarding

Now that we have the required business information saved, documents uploaded, and the bank account setup, we can finally submit our seller account for onboarding.

### Check Seller Onboarding Requirements

PublicSquare provides an [onboarding review endpoint](/api/accounts/review-onboarding-by-account-id) to be able to check the status of your onboarding requirements and submission status:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl -L 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts/acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf/onboarding/seller/review' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

If you have completed all of the previous steps, this should return a seller onboarding review response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
  "product": "seller",
  "onboarding_status": "in_progress",
  "step_requirements": [
    {
      "name": "business",
      "status": "complete"
    },
    {
      "name": "representative",
      "status": "complete"
    },
    {
      "name": "bank_account",
      "status": "complete"
    },
    {
      "name": "tax_information",
      "status": "complete"
    },
    {
      "name": "ultimate_beneficial_owners",
      "status": "complete"
    }
  ],
  "document_requirements": [
    {
      "document_id": "doc_5JqeKG6PJnWsR8Q2VRaaFL",
      "document_filename": "sample.pdf",
      "document_type": {
        "value": "articles_of_incorporation",
        "name": "Articles of Incorporation",
        "description": "Government issued document showing proof of business or articles of incorporation",
        "can_opt_out": true,
        "max_allowed_files": 1
      },
      "status": "complete"
    },
    {
      "document_id": "doc_Bqdgp1JhHBgvWHD8WdLhP5",
      "document_filename": "sample.jpg",
      "document_type": {
        "value": "personal_identification_front",
        "name": "Personal Identification (Front)",
        "description": "Picture of the front of valid government issued driver’s license, passport, or government issued identification",
        "can_opt_out": false,
        "max_allowed_files": 1
      },
      "status": "complete",
      "entity_id": "rep_LhDXFEioK3KLGW3Q4Q7mv3",
      "entity_type": "business_representative"
    },
    {
      "document_id": "doc_8KfFweP7BkT9GrvVk5VyPa",
      "document_filename": "sample.jpg",
      "document_type": {
        "value": "personal_identification_front",
        "name": "Personal Identification (Front)",
        "description": "Picture of the front of valid government issued driver’s license, passport, or government issued identification",
        "can_opt_out": false,
        "max_allowed_files": 1
      },
      "status": "complete",
      "entity_id": "ubo_K9Hjpm8cpE46CwmMhiMxm6",
      "entity_type": "ultimate_beneficial_owner"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Submit Seller Onboarding

Now that all of your requirements are `complete`, we can [submit the seller for underwriting](/api/accounts/onboard-by-account-id):

```shell showLineNumbers
curl 'https://api.publicsquare.com/accounts/acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf/onboarding/seller' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <SECRET_API_KEY>'
```

You should receive a response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "account_id": "acc_w6dogDaHuU6h1N5e5vfXLUYf",
  "product": "seller",
  // highlight-next-line
  "onboarding_status": "pending_review",
  ...
}
```

This will submit all of the provided information to our underwriting team to review the seller application.

You can receive automated notifications as your seller's onboarding status changes by [creating a webhook](/concepts/webhooks) and subscribing to the `onboarding:seller:update` event type.
