# Request Correlation

PublicSquare utilizes Correlation IDs to assist with request tracing, logging, and debugging.

All API endpoints accept a client-provided Correlation ID if sent with the `X-CORRELATION-ID` HTTP header within `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods.

If a `X-CORRELATION-ID` Correlation ID is not provided by the client, a new Correlation ID will be generated by the PublicSquare API.

### Example

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.publicsquare.com" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>" \
  -H "X-CORRELATION-ID: aa5d3379-6385-4ef4-9fdb-ca1341572153"
```
