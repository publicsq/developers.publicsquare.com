# Errors

PublicSquare uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate whether an API request succeeded or failed.
A response with a `2xx` status code indicates success, a `4xx` status code indicates a failure due to information provided with the request,
and a `5xx` status code indicates an unexpected error occurred within PublicSquare.

In general, errors are returned with a response body that conforms to the
[RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) specification, as illustrated below.
