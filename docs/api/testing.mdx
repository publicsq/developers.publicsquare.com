# Testing

To confirm that your integration works correctly, simulate transactions without moving any money using special values in `Test` environment.

Retrieve your `Test` API Keys from your [Account](https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys).

Test payment methods let you simulate several scenarios:

* Succeeded payments by card brand
* Card errors due to declines, fraud, or invalid data
* Refunds
* Payouts

When you're ready to take your integration live, replace your `Test` publishable and secret API keys with `Production` ones. You can't process live payments if your integration is still using your test API keys.

## Cards

The following card numbers can be used for testing your integration while in `Test` environment.

## Bank accounts

The following bank accounts can be used for testing your integration while in `Test` environment. The payment/payment status will initially be `pending`. For payments, after a short period of time, the payment status will be updated and
a `payment:update` [Webhook](/concepts/webhooks) will be sent with the payment in the `entity` of the payload. For payouts, the payout status will be updated and
a `payout:update` [Webhook](/concepts/webhooks) will be sent with the payout in the `entity` of the payload.

| Routing     | Number         | Payment Status | Decline Reason                 |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `110000000` | `000123456789` | `succeeded`    | N/A                            |
| `110000000` | `000111111113` | `declined`     | Account Closed                 |
| `110000000` | `000111111116` | `declined`     | Invalid Account Number         |
| `110000000` | `000222222227` | `declined`     | Insufficient Funds             |
| `110000000` | `000555555559` | `declined`     | Decline. Customer cancellation |
| `110000000` | `000333333335` | `declined`     | Stop Payment Order             |
| `110000000` | `000444444440` | `declined`     | Account Locked                 |


## Transaction amounts

You can use specific payment amounts to trigger different responses during processing. The test payment methods will be evaluated first before checking the payment amount:

| Amount($) | Authorize/Sale     | Capture    | Fraud Decision |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|----------------|
| 2000      | `rejected`         | N/A        | `accept`       |
| 3000      | `succeeded`        | N/A        | `review`       |
| 4000      | `error`            | N/A        | `accept`       |
| 5000      | `declined`         | N/A        | `accept`       |
| 6000      | `requires_capture` | `declined` | `accept`       |


## Dispute cases

You can use specific card payment amounts to trigger the generation of dipute cases to simulate chargebacks and inquries from the credit card networks. The test amount will be evaluated **only** for card payments, and generate
a dispute with the defined status. Adjustments to simulate the flow of back-and-forth of funds during a chargeback process will also be created:

| Amount($) | Status                   | Evidence Submitted | # of Adjustments |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 7000      | `needs_response`         | `false`            | 1                |
| 7100      | `under_review`           | `true`             | 2                |
| 7200      | `won`                    | `true`             | 2                |
| 7300      | `lost`                   | `true`             | 3                |
| 7400      | `warning_needs_response` | `false`            | 0                |
| 7500      | `warning_under_review`   | `true`             | 0                |
| 7600      | `warning_close`          | `true`             | 0                |
