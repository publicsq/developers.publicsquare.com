# IP Addresses

PublicSquare hosts its systems in multiple regions, but utilizes a list of static IP addresses for all outbound network traffic that your systems and firewalls can whitelist for inbound traffic.
These IP addresses are static - we will make the best effort to attempt to give **30-day** notifications to changes to this list.
The following is a list of IP addresses by region for PublicSquare systems:

## North America

- 34.28.88.150
- 35.223.223.212
- 34.73.197.168
- 34.148.13.87

<Alert>For security reasons, the only egress port enabled by default is 443. Please, [reach out for support](mailto:support@publicsquare.com) if you require a different egress port opened.</Alert>
