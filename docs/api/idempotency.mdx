# Idempotency

PublicSquare supports idempotency to guarantee multiple retries of the same request do not
unintentionally perform the same operation more than once.

Our API endpoints accept a client-provided `Idempotency Key` if sent with the `IDEMPOTENCY-KEY` `HTTP` header within `POST` and `PUT` methods.

If an `Idempotency Key` is not provided by the client, retrying the same request might result in unwanted behavior.

The `Idempotency Key` must be a unique value generated by the client which is used by the PublicSquare
API to identify subsequent requests belong to an original request. The `Idempotency Key` generation is up to the
client, but we strongly recommend using a unique identifier such as `UUID` to avoid collisions.

When the first request comes in, its response status code and body is saved. Whenever a subsequent
request comes in with the same `Idempotency Key`, the previous stored result will be returned if it
succeeded. If the first request failed, the result is not stored and a subsequent request with the
same `Idempotency Key` is processed as a new request. If any subsequent request comes in while
the first is still processing, a `409` status code is returned.

If an `Idempotency Key` is provided for a `GET` or `DELETE` request, it is ignored and idempotency logic
is not invoked, since these `HTTP` verbs are idempotent by definition.

All idempotency keys and their respective results are deleted after 24 hours. Therefore, if an
`Idempotency Key` is reused after 24 hours, it will be handled as a new request.

### Example

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.publicsquare.com" \
-H "X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>" \
-H "IDEMPOTENCY-KEY: aa5d3379-6385-4ef4-9fdb-ca1341572153"
```
