# Fraud Prevention

This document provides an overview of fraud prevention tools available through PSQ Payments. It includes steps for setting up Address Verification Service (AVS) and Card Verification Value (CVV) checks, essential tools for minimizing fraudulent transactions and chargebacks.

## Why use fraud prevention tools?

Fraud prevention tools like AVS and CVV checks add layers of security by verifying critical payment details. These tools help:

- Prevent unauthorized transactions
- Reduce the likelihood of chargebacks
- Increase customer trust by safeguarding sensitive information

## Address Verification Service (AVS)

### What is AVS?

AVS verifies the billing address provided by the customer during a transaction. It checks this information against the card issuer’s records and returns a response code indicating the level of match.

### How does AVS work?

1.	Customer enters their billing address at checkout.
2.	The address is sent to the card issuer for verification.
3.	The issuer compares the address with the one on file.
4.	A response code is returned, indicating whether the address matches.

### Steps to set up AVS in PSQ Payments

1.	**Access the Fraud Management Settings**

    -	Log in to the Nuvei Portal.
    -	Navigate to **Risk Configurations** under the **Risk** section.

2.	**Enable AVS Verification**

    -	Locate the AVS configuration panel.
    -	Enable AVS by toggling the switch or checkbox.

3.	**Set AVS Rules**

    -	Define acceptable AVS response codes based on your risk tolerance:
    -	Full match (billing address and ZIP code match).
    -	Partial match (e.g., ZIP code matches but address does not).
    -	Set rules to automatically decline transactions for unacceptable matches.

4.	**Save Your Settings**

    -	Click **Save** to activate the AVS settings.

### Recommended AVS best practices

- Require a full AVS match for high-value transactions.
- For partial matches, flag the transaction for manual review.
- Regularly review AVS reports to refine your risk settings.

## Card Verification Value (CVV)

### What is CVV?

CVV is the 3- or 4-digit code printed on a customer’s payment card. It verifies that the cardholder has physical access to the card, adding a layer of protection against card-not-present (CNP) fraud.

### How does CVV Work?

1.	Customer enters their card details, including the CVV, during checkout.
2.	The CVV is sent to the card issuer for verification.
3.	The issuer verifies the CVV and returns a response indicating whether it matches.

### Steps to Set Up CVV in PSQ Payments

1.	**Access the Fraud Management Settings**

    -	Log in to the Nuvei Portal.
    -	Navigate to **Risk Configurations** under the **Risk** section.

2.	**Enable CVV Verification**

    -	Locate the CVV configuration panel.
    -	Enable CVV checks by toggling the switch or checkbox.

3.	**Set CVV Rules**

    -	Define rules for CVV verification:
    -	Require a valid CVV for all transactions.
    -	Automatically decline transactions with invalid or missing CVVs.

4.	**Save Your Settings**

    -	Click **Save** to activate the CVV settings.

### Recommended CVV best practices

-	Always require CVV for card-not-present transactions.
-	Decline transactions with missing or invalid CVVs.
-	Use CVV in combination with AVS for enhanced fraud protection.
