# API keys

API keys are used to authenticate with the PublicSquare API. All API keys contain one or more [permissions](#permissions) which will
provide ability to manage your account, collect payment methods, and process payments.

## Key types

There are three API key types, which enable different levels of access to the PublicSquare API.

| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publishable` | A publishable key an auto-generated, non-sensitive API key which can be used in your mobile or web application to collect payment methods. Publishable keys only contain the `payment-method:capture` permission. A single publishable key is generated when your account is created and cannot be edited or removed, but can have the [key regenerated](/api/accounts/regenerate-api-key).                     |
| `secret`      | A secret key is an auto-generated, sensitive API key type which contains all permissions to fully manage your account, collect payment methods, and process transactions. Secret keys are the most permissable API key in an account. A single publishable key is generated when your account is created and cannot be edited or removed, but can have the [key regenerated](/api/accounts/regenerate-api-key). |
| `restricted`  | A restricted key enables granting granular access to your account. When a [restricted key is created](/api/accounts/create-api-key), it contains one or more permissions which defines what endpoints can be accessed. You can create one or more restricted keys per account for various business uses.                                                                                                        |

## Permissions

Permissions enable granular access to PublicSquare API endpoints. A `publishable` API key only has the `payment-method:capture` permission, however a `secret` API key has access to all permissions. Restricted API keys can be created to provide limited access to the API for specific use cases.
